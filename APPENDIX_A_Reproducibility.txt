APPENDIX A — Experimental Reproducibility
A.1 Environment Setup

All experiments were executed using the PQChainSim simulation framework developed for this study.
The environment specifications are as follows:

Programming Language: Python 3.10 or later

Dependencies: pandas, numpy, matplotlib

These packages support statistical processing, structured data logging, and visualization.

A.2 Experimental Execution

The simulation experiments were conducted through a controlled execution sequence to ensure repeatability and consistency.

Run Consensus Simulations (with Adversarial Checks)
Execute the main experimental script:

python main_with_adversary.py


Outputs:

blockchain_metrics.csv — records per-block data, including verify_time_sec (s), valid (bool), block_size (bytes), alg, payload_bytes, exp_tag, and run_id.

verification_log.csv — stores run-level summaries (kind=summary), capturing tps, p50_ms, p95_ms, and valid_ratio. It also includes adversarial test results (kind=adversarial) for tamper and replay detection.

Generate Statistical Tables (Chapter IV Results)
The aggregated results were compiled using:

python make_tables.py


Generated Tables:

Table_4_1_summary_by_algorithm.csv

Table_4_2_verify_time_by_algorithm.csv

Table_4_3_block_size_by_algorithm.csv

Table_4_4_tps_by_payload.csv

adversarial_outcomes.csv

Generate Analytical Figures
Visualization of key performance metrics was produced using:

python plot_figures.py


Generated Figures:

Figure_1_TPS_by_Payload.png

Figure_2_Latency_Box_by_Alg.png

Figure_3_Block_Size_by_Alg.png

Figure_4_Validity_by_Alg.png

A.3 Default Parameters (Aligned with Manuscript)
Parameter	Default Value
Nodes	8
Consensus Rounds	200 (paper range: 100–200)
Trials per Configuration	3
Payload Sizes	512 bytes, 2048 bytes

These default values replicate the configuration used for all experiments discussed in section III.

A.4 Notes on Measurement and Determinism

Throughput (TPS) was computed as a verification-throughput proxy within the simulator, defined as:

𝑇
𝑃
𝑆
=
Rounds
∑
(
verify_time_sec
)
TPS=
∑(verify_time_sec)
Rounds
	​


Latency metrics (p50, p95) represent the median and 95th percentile verification times, reported in milliseconds (ms).

Block sizes are recorded in bytes.

Randomness and scheduling are controlled deterministically, ensuring full reproducibility across multiple runs.
